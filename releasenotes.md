## Release notes

### Development version

* New optimization script `optimize_kptsdensity.py` for k-point density optimization instead of k-point number optimization.
* `optimize_cutoff.py`, `optimize_kpoints.py` and `optimize_latticeparam.py` have `xc_used` in parameters list.
* Naming of some of the output files are fixed. 
* Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) solution is added to optical calculations.
* 7 new keywords are added for BSE calculations. `opttype`, `optshift`, `optBSEvb`, `optbsecb`, `optBSEminEn`, `optBSEmaxEn`, `optbsenumdata`
* `Si-2atoms-optical` example is now running for both RPA and BSE. Previously, its calculation has 2 steps , now 3 steps.
* CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT information is added.
* Fix: Show atom numbers starting from 1 not 0.

### Version 22.3.0

* New calculation: with `Elastic_calc=True`, Equation of State and elastic tensor values will be calculated.
* `Elastic_calc` is added to `gg.py`.
* A new example about elastic calculations is added.
* Many comments added to `gg.py` for better understanding the code.
* `DOS_npoints` and `DOS_width` variables are added for number of points and smearing value, respectively.
* Saving PNG versions of band structure and DOS even in -d argument is not used.
* `shrinkgpw.py`command for extracting wavefunctions from huge gpw files and save with a different name.
* New benchmarks were added.

### Version 21.12.0

* EXX mode is renamed as PW-EXX.
* Default values of variables are changed.
* Previous -i (input) argument is changed as -g (geometry). It is more logical, because it is used for geometry.
* Previous -c (config) argument is changed as -i (input). It is more general, convenient and understandable.
* `gg.py` can now work with just enough number of variables. Previously, it must see all variables.
* `kpts_density` is added.
* Units used in cube file are changed for Bader analysis.
* There is no general config file anymore.
* Small bugfixes.

### Version 21.11.0

* PDOS calculations.
* PW mode can use GLLB-SC xc now.
* `optimize_cutoff.py` and `optimize_kpoints.py` can use CIF, XYZ, etc... files as input file. No need to include the ASE object inside these scripts anymore.
* The nbands parameter is changed in PW mode.
* In GW calculations, calculation could not be done because of interpolation in drawing the figure when the data did not have a minimum of 3 points. Now there is a variable to use interpolation or not.
* In GW calculations, `gpawsolve.py` can write quasiparticle energies to a file separately.
* DFT+U calculation ability is added for PW and LCAO modes.
* `gg.py` is better now. It is compatible with new arguments and removed variables. It can run in any directory and handling of `GWkpoints` and `GWtruncation` variables are correct now.
* A new argument '-d' is added. This argument makes script draw the DOS and band calculation results. In the past, it was a varible in the config file.
* `WantedCIFexport` variable is removed. 
* A new argument '-r' is added. This argument makes script pass the ground state calculations and continue with the next calculation.

### Version 21.10.1

* An important bug made it impossible to work with existing examples with `gg.py`. It is now resolved.

### Version 21.10.0

* 5 different examples are added to show simply different usage cases.
* Initializing magnetic moment problem is solved.
* Version argument is added.
* GW parameters are also added to `gg.py`
* Add some optical parameters to config files and `gg.py`.
* Major change: `gpawsolve.py` and `gg.py` are now working as commands. Config files can be used as general input files, you can put ASE Atom object plus every parameter that `gpawsolve.py` accepts. If you want, you can provide a CIF file instead of using an atom object. You can run `gpawsolve.py` and `gg.py` from any folder.
* Optical: Refractive index, extinction index, absorption, and reflectivity calculations.
* `gg.py` is now opening ase gui when the user clicks the structure image.
* New argument parsing scheme for better future usages.
* Very basic PW-EXX mode with HSE06 and PBE06. (Only some ground-state calculations.)
* Adding GW0 and G0W0-GW0 selector.
* Adding GW approximation to `gpawsolve.py` (only bands).
* Many other small corrections.

### Version 21.9.0

* Corrected `quickoptimize.py` behaviour.
* Many code quality and folder structure improvements.
* Comment additions to code.
* Better README.md.
* `gg.py` which is a GUI for gpaw-tools is added to project. It can do all `gpawsolve.py`'s features in a graphical way!
* `gpawsolve.py` can be run solely as a command now (This is needed for a GUI project).
* All three scripts`PW-Electronic.py`, `LCAO-Electronic.py` and `PW-Optical-SingleCoreOnly.py` scripts becomes a single for-all-case script: `gpawsolve.py`.
* `PW-Electronic-changename.py` script becomes `PW-Electronic.py`.
* Spin-polarized results in `PW-Electronic-changename.py` script.
* All-electron density calculations in `PW-Electronic-changename.py`.
* CIF Export in `PW-Electronic-changename.py` script.
* Better parallel computation.
* Several XCs available for PW.
* `LCAO-Electronic.py` script.
* Strain minimization in PW only. 
* BFGS to LBFGS, Small many changes have been done.

### Preversion
* `PW-Optical-SingleCoreOnly.py` script for optical calculations.
* `PW-Electronic-changename.py` script for electronic calculations. 
* First scripts for personal usage.
