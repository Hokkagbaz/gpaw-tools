# Welcome to *gpaw-tools*
{: .fs-9 }

*gpaw-tools* is a collection of python scripts that use ASE and GPAW for performing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Its aim is to lower the entry barrier and to provide an easy-to-use command line and graphical user interfaces for GPAW. It is mostly written for new DFT users who are running codes on their own PCs or on small group clusters.

`gpaw-tools` have:
1. A force-field quick optimization script `quickoptimization.py` for preliminary calculations using ASAP3/OpenKIM potentials. 
2. `ciftoase.py` script for transform CIF files to ASE's own Atoms object.
3. To choose better cut off energy, lattice parameter and k points, there are 3 scripts called `optimize_cutoff.py`, `optimize_latticeparam.py` and `optimize_kpoints.py`.
4. The main solver script `gpawsolver.py` which can be run in PW (also with GW and EXX) or LCAO mode. It can do structure optimization, can use several different XCs, can do spin-polarized calculations, can calculate, draw and save tidily DOS and band structures, can calculate and save all-electron densities and can calculate optical properties in a very simple and organized way.
5. A simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for `gpawsolve.py` (and also you may say that GUI for GPAW) which is called `gg.py`.
