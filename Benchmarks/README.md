# Benchmarks
Current file is a similar to our electronic structure calculation script.
For better performance do not use `total number of cores` that your computer provides. Instead, try to use `total number of cores - 1` as general. Use `time` command to measure the time passed as:
```
time mpiexec -n 7 gpaw python GPAWSimpleBenchmark2021.py
```
This will result something like:
```
       Step     Time          Energy         fmax
