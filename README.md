# gpaw-tools
## Introduction
gpaw-tools is a bunch for python scripts for easy performing of GPAW calculations:
1. A force-field quick optimization script `quickoptimization.py` for preliminary calculations using ASAP3/OpenKIM potentials. 
2. `ciftoase.py` script for transform CIF files to ASE's own Atoms object.
3. To choose better cut off energy, lattice parameter and k points, there are 3 scripts called `Optimize-CutOff.py`, `Optimize-Lattice.py` and `Optimize-KPoints.py`.
4. And, the main solver script `gpawsolver.py` which can be run in PW or LCAO mode. It can do strain minimization, can use several different XCs, can do spin-polarized calculations, can calculate, draw and save tidily DOS and band structures, can calculate and save all-electron densities and can calculate optical properties in a very simple and organized way.
