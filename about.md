## About *gpaw-tools*

As an academic research group [LRG](https://www.lrgresearch.org), we are capable to conduct both experimental and calculations studies. Since 2011, we have been working on low-dimensional structures with a DFT tool ATK (later called QuantumATK). After the ATK was being purchased by Synopsys, we had some license problems with the Europractice scheme and with the pandemic rises at the beginning of 2020, we were looking for a new DFT tool for our further studies.

ASE/GPAW was our choice because of their combined capabilities. ASE is a very powerful software. And for GPAW, we can easily say that it is possible to use both PW and LCAO modes with GPAW. And it is possible to use ASE+ASAP+OpenKIM inter-atomic potentials as pre-optimization for geometry. These properties are very similar to ATK's features, that we are looking for.

As a hybrid group, one of the important things is easy usage. ASE/GPAW usage needs Python knowledge. However, we want to enter input parameters and get the output data type usage like other DFT software. We are not interested in Python's abilities, and we do not have time for it, we are interested in our physics studies' results.

Therefore, the gpaw-tools project was started. With the `gpawsolve.py` script (not a module, it is just a script!) we aimed to start UI creation for ASE/GPAW. And with `gg.py`, we want to show that a GUI is possible.

We hope it was a good start. It is a simple tool now and we want to implement many ASE/GPAW's features inside it. Therefore, we need help. Please use/extend the software and create issues and pull requests on our [Github page](https://github.com/lrgresearch/gpaw-tools).

Thanks for using gpaw-tools.
